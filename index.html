              I am an educator and developer from the midwest. I called Mexico
              home for 10 years and have recently made the transition to San
              Diego. My journey into tech started through my years in education.
              The future comes quickly and it was important to me to have the
              skills and tools to keep up. I love helping students inside the
              classroom and wanted to be able to help outside the classroom as
              well. Moving forward I want to combine my love of education with
              my new love of front-end development and instructional design. As
              a bilingual educator, English and Spanish, and my background in
              curriculum development, educational philosophy and project
              management skills, I hope to keep building bridges and creating
              content in my community through web design and e-learning
              experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              My focus is on creating clean & user friendly experiences. Using
              HTML/CSS & Javascript I make responsive webpages writing in easy
              to read code. Do you have the idea for your dream site? You can
              trust me to make your idea come to life identical to your
              designer's PSD. Let's make things together! Check out my projects
              in the menu below or head over to my Github!

                I have a solid foundation as an effective bilingual communicator
                (English/Spanish), trainer and teacher, with an ability to
                transfer such leadership skills to a variety of organizational
                structures. As a teacher of over 10 years I am effective in
                assessing and analyzing data and changing instruction based on
                findings in order to create a more efficient and successful
                approach to solving problems. I use Adobe Captivate to make
                e-learning content and would love to work with your team to
                create successful approaches to solving problems.
